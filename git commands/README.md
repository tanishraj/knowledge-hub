# What is version control?

Version control is a system that helps track changes to files over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project by keeping a history of changes, so you can:

1. **Revert to Previous Versions:** If something goes wrong, you can go back to a previous state.
2. **Track Changes:** You can see who made what changes, when, and why.
3. **Collaborate Efficiently:** Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.

Git is one of the most popular version control systems. It helps manage the codebase of a project, especially when multiple developers are involved. GitHub, on the other hand, is a platform that hosts Git repositories online, enabling easier collaboration and sharing.
